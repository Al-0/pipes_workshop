              I was going through some old things I had in storage and came across our old school {{ items | slice:2:3 }}. I was flipping through the pages when I came across your photo, which had a quote in french: "{{ "fr" | i18nSelect:translations }}".<br>
              My little trip down memory lane made me wonder what you have been up to all these years, where are you living now and what has life brought to you after {{ emotion | lowercase }}?<br>

              On the work front, I am a web developer with a six figure salary! (something around {{ money | currency:'EUR':'symbol':'':'en' }}). <br>
              What about you? Tell me a little about what you are doing! I have enclosed some current photos of my cat!, if you have any recent photos I would love to see them! I'm {{ hype | percent }} hoping to hear back from you, really looking forward to learning all about what you have been up to and where you have been all this time!<br>

              Dear Michelle,<br>
              It's been a while since we last spoke, with all the time that has passed, I think it has been around 7 years now if my memory serves me correctly? As I write this, today is {{ formattedDate }}.<br>
              I was going through some old things I had in storage and came across our old school yearbook. I was flipping through the pages when I came across your photo, which had a quote in french: "C'est La Vie".<br>
              My little trip down memory lane made me wonder what you have been up to all these years, where are you living now and what has life brought to you after all this time?<br>
              Are you married? Any children? I am now living in DC with my partner Jay and we have been married 2.5 years now.<br>
              On the work front, I am a web developer with a six figure salary! (something around â‚¬120,000.00). <br>
              What about you? Tell me a little about what you are doing! I have enclosed some current photos of my cat!, if you have any recent photos I would love to see them! I'm 100% hoping to hear back from you, really looking forward to learning all about what you have been up to and where you have been all this time!<br>
              All the best, Your Good Old Friend.<br>
